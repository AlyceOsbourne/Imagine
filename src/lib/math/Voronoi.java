intentions of this class:
to create a generified voronoi algorithm that can use different distances such as manhatten distances.
I guess then end product should be an abstract class so that we can wrap it to utilize for various uses
such as image creation, pathfinding on a 2d plane,to calculate distances from vectors etc
note, if this only works for a single use case I have failed

a few rules for this class, it should be able to run at as close to realtime as possible,
even with points in the 10,000-100,000 range
should be able to be dynamic, so if a new site is added it does not need to update
the whole graph but the local neighbours that are adjacent

now, while I do like the look of the beach line approach I am not sure if that is actually the best approach given the intentions of the class.
now, I have done some study into the jump flood algorithm and it seems hugely efficient, and there are several approaches so I am sure I can
achieve a high level of accuracy while maintaining performance.

now, we are taking an abstract approach here, jump flooding was intended fo gpu applications,
but when you really abstract it its just a data processor for a 2d/3d dataset,
so we should be able to make use of it to create voronoi data that can be applied to things later.
I have chosen this approach due o the efficient nature of the data clustering
